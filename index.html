      <h1><a href="#">Post about how ya'll just super sucksss</a></h1>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-summary">
      <p>So, I wanted to write a blog and like document some stuff but couldn't get the time out really but this is what this is all about
        So this is about how everything and everyone just totally sucks and how everyone of you are super useless annoying and good for nothing, no this ain't a rant post or I am sad post 
        or me trying to be just cool and whatever gahahaha who all might try and feel to look cool, but just know that you all completely sucks and everything and everyone of you are just so naive to consider that the other person
        on the other side is making actual efforts to make you feel good when you come to him devastated/sad/confused/depressed or just want to talk to on your not so good day, and even if you are just feeling normal/low/basic which you all actually are,

        but still the other person tries his best to make you feel good hold you up, make you feel how good you are and how good you can do further and everything is just chill and its a phase of life, and that person is actually concerned for you and keeps thinking even after your convo ends 
        that if you are okay but you suckkk so much that you didnt make a single effort of actually acknowledging the feelings of that person you just talked to.

        Because when he wants someone to talk to just not because he got some issues or depressed stuff but just want to talk, every one is just super busy, tired, involved, in a middle of damn fucking something and got no time to talk to the person who was
        expecting something from you in return and was lowkey happy that he got some one to share stuff. But you are not just a person you are someone I can actually expect something from but you are just concerned about making yourself feel uplifted the whole damn time ignoring that the other person might need you
        So, yeah you all just sucks and I no longer expect anything from anyone else, I am happy with my life like super happy infact i don't even need anyone basically i was just following the trend of social interaction and making acquintances even if I knew you all are just so basic, selfish, stupid, cringy, good for nothing, 
        complete piece of shit, or just you(yeah that alone could have worked the best). So, yes sucking is the only thing you are good at, please dont text me or call me regarding this post if you somehow randomly end up landing over this and read this whole stuff, like the real truth and not just something I wrote out of frustration,

        I just wrote it to let everyone or anyone who reads this know that you basically suck. 

        I dont get the whole point, like everyone is soo busy to even acknowledge someone else's actions and not just regular actions he does for you dumb heads,
        Everyone is just so busy to get a pussy, a pussy job, a feeling of mild satisfaction, validation etcetra etcetra.
